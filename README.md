Daily Schedule

This is a planner you can use to make plans for your daily life.

To run my project either download the entire repo and open the index.html file with a browser, or use my [deployed link here](https://sam-st.github.io/daily-schedule/)

To use my project you first want to open it, upon opening the page you will notice the title, and the current date at the top of the page. The colored boxes below these items are colored according to the current time (past is gray, current is red and future is green). You can type in these boxes and put down things that you need to get done by those hours, like a planner. To save what you typed click on the corresponding save button next to the text box and it will store the data in localStorage. Feel free to refresh the page after this and your data will remain inside the textbox.
